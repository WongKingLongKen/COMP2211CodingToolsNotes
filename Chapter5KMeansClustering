KMC (unsupervised learning) is good for its low cost (no labeling) and finding features before categorization



K-means clustering is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum by iteratively minimizing the intra-cluster variance

In K-Means clustering, using Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance can produce better results, 
especially when dealing with sparse high-dimensional data or when outliers are present.
