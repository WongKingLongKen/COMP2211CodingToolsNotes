image preprocssing - process an image s.t the resulting image is more suitable than the original one for a specific application

digital image - 2d grid of intensity value I(x,y)

why use grayscale image (value of each pixel or dot carries intensity info only, 8-bit data 2^8=256)?
data are smaller and allow us to process the image in a shorter time

affine transformation:
any transformation that preserves collinearity, parallelism, etc
translation, scaling, etc are all affine trans.
