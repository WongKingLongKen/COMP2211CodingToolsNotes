```
import numpy as np

A = np.array([5, 1, 3])
ranks = np.argsort(np.argsort(A))  # Result: [2, 0, 1]
```

The first argsort gives sorted indices after ascending the orders.
The second argsort acts as an inverse permutation, converting sorted indices back to the original positions and assigning ranks.
